# LIN371_code_demo-Public
Code demo for LIN 371, UT Austin

**PyTorch Preliminary**
* nn_sentiment: transforming from Keras to PyTorch

**BERT for classification (dataset: HW3 movie-reviews)**
* Inferencing from pre-trained BERT: show tokenization and how Bert does sub-word tokenization compared to how OpenAI does it (show the OpenAI website)
* Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT

**Seq-to-seq models (dataset: WMT18_Zh-En)**
* Inferencing pre-trained Seq2seq models (BART) for translation
* Fine-tune BART for translation

**Large Language Models**
* Inferencing open-sourced LLMs
* Inferencing OpenAI models
